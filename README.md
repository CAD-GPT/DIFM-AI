Steps to Run DIFM AI App
1. Open a New Gooogle Colab notebook and upload ai_chairs_dataset-training.txt file in the storage option
2. Copy the code in nanoGPT.py, trainingLoop.py and generateDesigns.py into google colab cells and run them in this order
3. Copy the generated designs (plaintext in the code output) into the ai-chair-generated_XLS.xls file and ensure that the code is following the TDL syntax
4. Extract Fusion_360_Decoder.zip folder and run fusion_360_Decoder.py file from the "Scripts and Addin"s option under "Utilities" Tab in a blank Fusion 360 file
